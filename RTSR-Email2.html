<Title>NTIRE 2023 Real-Time Super-Resolution Challenge - SEU_CNII</Title>

<p>Dear organizers:</p>

<p>
    I hope this email finds you well.
    I am writing to inform you that there were some errors in the results I submitted for the NTIRE 2023 Real-Time
    Super-Resolution Challenge Track 1 & 2.
    After reviewing my submission, I realized that the SR outputs in our previous submissions are incorrect. 
    I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
</p>

<p>
    Following are the links to corrected results, and I would appreciate it if you could update the competition results
    accordingly.
