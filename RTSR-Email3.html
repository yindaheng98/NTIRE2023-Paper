<Title>NTIRE 2023 Real-Time Super-Resolution Challenge - SEU_CNII</Title>

<p>Dear organizers:</p>

<p>
    Apologize for our unclear instruction.
    I am writing to give some explaination about our code.
</p>

<h3>How to load our model</h3>

<p>
    We have modified our code following the guidelines you give.
    The function <code>srmodel()</code> has been put in <code>arch.py</code> and the <code>checkpoint.pth</code> has been included according to the guidelines.
    To run our code, you should extract <code>models/</code>,<code>arch.py</code> and <code>checkpoint.pth</code> from
    our submitted zip file, and put them in the same directory with your test code:

<pre>
|--- models/
|--- arch.py
|--- checkpoint.pth
|--- your-test-code.py
</pre>

in <code>your-test-code.py</code> you can write:

<pre>
from arch import srmodel
model = srmodel()
</pre>

to load our model.
</p>

<h3>Why our model should be loaded directly by <code>model = torch.load('checkpoint.pth')</code></h3>

<p>
    Essentially, our Track 1 model is in <code>models/rfdn_half/RFDNB4S.py</code> and Track 2 model is in <code>models/rfdn_half/RFDNB2S.py</code>.
    You can load them by

<pre>
from models.rfdn_half.RFDNB4S import RFDNB4S_P
model = RFDNB4S_P() # Track 1
</pre>

<pre>
from models.rfdn_half.RFDNB2S inport RFDNB2S_P
model = RFDNB2S_P() # Track 2
</pre>

But since we applied auto-pruning to our model, state dict in <code>checkpoint.pth</code> could not be loaded into
the original model.
That is why you should directly load the model by <code>model = torch.load('checkpoint.pth')</code>(as is written in our <code>arch.py</code>).
</p>
